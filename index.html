    <p>Food is the absolute main source of nutrients humans can get. As technology, availability, and migration of people across the country has changed, so has the food we buy, grow, cook, and enjoy. It has the ability to regulate and enhance energy, growth, and bodily functions like breathing and staying warm. Eating good meals improves health, causing the strengthening of our immune system to fight off diseases. Children who eat well grow up to be healthy and mothers who eat well give birth to healthy babies.</p>
    <p>Carbohydrates, fats, and protein are nutrients we need in large amounts. Minerals and vitamins are vital that we need in smaller amounts. Carboyhdrates like startches and sugars benefit breathing, movement, warmth, growth, and repair of tissues; carbohydrates like fibre is used to produce faeces to absorb harmful chemicals, help keep the gut healthy, and prevent obesity. Fats are needed for growth, health, and better absorption of vitamin A. Proteins are required to build cells, body fluids, antibodies and strengthen parts of the immune system. With adequate minerals and vitamins, bodily roles are perfected like strengthening bones, healing wounds, flourishing immune systems, healing cellular damage, and converting food into energy. </p>
    <p>Since the beginning of time, people were brought together through sharing good food. People use food to express themselves, establish communities, and show creativity. A wonderful meal comes with making friends, strengthening relationships, celebrating achievements, and feeling grateful. All foods have their unique symbolic meaning in different parts of the world. Deep connections can be formed simply through a meal and sharing common favorites can serve to be the first in many connections.  </p>

    <p>Food can serve as one's tradition and wherever they go, there will always be a way of preserving their culture. The most important part about food is being able to enjoy it with everyone you love and care for.   </p>
