  <h1>Chinese Cuisine</h1>
  
  <p>Chinese cuisine is closely correlated with its culture and has now spread worldwide. The Four Great Traditions of chinese cuisine include Chuan (west), Lu (north), Yue (south), and Huaiyang (east). The color, smell, and taste all categorize aspects of traditional descriptions for chinese food. Traditional chinese medicine was able to draw in the vast attention to gastronomy for chinese society. During the Han dynasty, food preservations were studied to make it convenient for military purposes. This would include drying meat and grains, as well as roasted flat breads known as shaobing. Chinese people largely believe good food is important to enjoy with family to bring harmonious and close relationships. All foods have their own meaning and to express them fully, the highlight of people's days is going out to buy fresh ingredients everyday. Food served to guests can also show respect to them. Chinese cuisines also includes beliefs like never serving 4 or 10 dishes because in chinese dialet, it is a homophone to the word 'death'. Having these amounts of dishes would likely serve to be bad luck. Chinese culture has taken great influence around the world and its foods would inevitably spread as well. Other countries have altered popular foods to accomodated their tastebud. A prominent example would be a successful fast food chain called 'Panda Express'. Popular symbolic meanings to dishes would be describing them as luck, longevity and prosperity. Last but not least, unforgettable chinese cuisines will bring a sense of happiness, which would also be represented by oranges and other citrus fruits. </p>
